## What is Internet?
- The Internet is a vast network of wires (and wireless systems) that connect different computers around the world.

- These computers can be located anywhere (even in different cities or countries) and can communicate and transfer data with one another.

- Servers are special computers that store and serve the data and files needed to access and interact with websites.

- Any computer that a user uses to access the Internet is called a client.

## How internet works?
- You type a URL (like www.google.com) in your browser.

- The browser sends that request to your ISP (Internet Service Provider).

- The ISP forwards the request to a DNS (Domain Name System) server.

- DNS has IP (Internet Protocol) adddress of all websites in the database, so when ISP sends the request, DNS tries to find exact IP address in the database of the website that are you tring to access.

- Every single computer(device) that's  connected to the internet has an unique IP address (like postal code for the computer).

- Once the DNS server finds that IP address, it will send it back to your browser through the ISP, then browser can make a direct request to that address.

- And then server receives the request and responds by sending the necessary files back to your browser.



- You can look up the IP address of the any webpage/website using [www.nslookup.io](https://www.nslookup.io/)

## How Do websites actually work?

- A client sends a request to a server, and the server responds by sending back files.

    These files typically consist of three types of files HTML, CSS, JS.:

    HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web page.

    CSS: Handles the styling and layout of the web page.

    JavaScript (JS): Adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to the website.
